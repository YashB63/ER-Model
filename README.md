# ER-Model
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the Entity-Relationship (ER) model, which is used for designing and representing the structure of a database. 

The ER model helps in understanding the structure and organization of data within a system, facilitating effective database design and development. It provides a clear representation of entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality, enabling stakeholders to visualize and communicate the database structure efficiently.
